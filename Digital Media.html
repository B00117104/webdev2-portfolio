<p> So you have made it to this part of my Internet Zone to a place I like to call the Meadows of Media.This is the location where I have my videos that I have made in the past and also a link to my website that I made a few months ago on the tv show Brooklyn Nine-Nine:

<h2> Beware of the Stare </h2>
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/305512541" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>This was the video that I made back in my first semester in College, which is known as Beware of the Stare. This was assigned to us to do as part of the large part of the CA percentage. The film's concept was thought up by me and another student named Zhen. We filmed this over the spa of a few hours back around late November/ Early December and the film is about a student (played by David) being haunted and Traumatized by a notepad page ghost. Just when you thought College couldn't get any more scary.</p>

<h2> Coach Craig</h2>

<p>This was one of the earliest short films that I have been involved in and it is part of an era that I like to call: The pre-Beard days (as I look like I'm about 12 in these films). This was a project that I was involved in to a point that I am a character in the film (I play the Janitor of the school) and it is a film about murder, conspiracy and fear (with a blooper reel at the end).</p>

<h2>Project Small Rings</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6CmAVFCyI5I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>this was another film that I was involved in to a large capacity that was also part of The Pre-Beard Days. This was a satire parody on the Lord of the Rings series set in the modern day where their styles were easily known symptoms, such as whobit having Dwarfism, Gandelf being addicted to drugs and so on. I played the role of Gandelf the receptionist of Doc Bocter. I also had a major part in this film as I was the one who edited this whole film, with music and everything, which is what helped me with learning how to properly edit</p>

<h2>Eternal Vengence </h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1izTSw8oFy4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p> Now with this film, I didn't have that much of a mjaor role with this fil. I wasn't a character in it, but I was involved with a small percentage of the writing in th efilm, which is about the worlds greatest psyc- I mean Cop named Roland Lockjaw, who must stop Terrorists from taking over Ireland and some other stuff like that </p> 


<h2> My original First Website</h2>

<p> Back in my first Semester of College for my Web Development lecture we were assigned to do create a 10 page website based on a choice of 5 themes. I decided on the theme of Tv Shows and I based it on one of my favourite TV shows of Brooklyn Nine-Nine. It was based and made over the course of about a month and a bit and consisted on images, videos, opinion pieces, quotes, discriptions of characters and episodes and also a lot of HTMLs and a CSS stylesheets. It all thankfully worked out well and I did very well in the end </p>
