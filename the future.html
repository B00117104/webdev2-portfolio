<h3> So..... What happens next? </h3>

<p>So, you have reached the part of the Internet Zone where I talk directly to you, the audience about what happens next</p>

<p>What you see here on the end of this website portfolio is not the end for me, it is just the beginning of what I have planned and what I have in mind. I will continue to draw because that is one the main and big ways that I have to express myself and show the world what I have. I also plan to continue to make my videos, most notably my little comedy skits that I make on my Social Media stories from time to time and the characters that I have already created will be expanded and new ones are introduced as time goes on.</p>

<p>I also hope that I will eventually get around to starting my Youtube channel that I have been planning out for about 2 years now which will consist of many things including a mix of variety like blogs, how to guide, gameplays, deep opinions, Reviews, cooking, a bit of singing, Animation and even some of my old videos in the process.</p>

<p>I also hope to achieve some of my own personal goals, including getting back into acting so I can go on to become a famous Actor, Director or Animator. I continue to make new friends over the next few years. I also end up falling in love and telling someone I know how I truly feel (if my lingering Shyness Doesnâ€™t get in the way). I graduate from my four-year term at College with High Honours and go on to do great things. I also hope to become more confident, but most importantly I continue to be who i am today because there is no one that is going to change who I am.</p>

<p> This brings us to the end of our little journey through the land known Simply as The Internet Zone, until me meet again I bid you farewell and hopefully our paths will cross once again in the near future. Only time will tell</p>
