<h3> How I got my start on the INTERNET ZONE (well most of it): The College Crypt</h3>

<p> So you have reached the part of the Internet Zone known as the College Crypt. So, this is where I find myself in life now, at my third level of education. Here I will have the content for what I have created in my time here so far in my first 2 semester and I hope you enjoy them</p>

<h3> Semester 1</h3>
<p>So, This was where it all began. The beginning of a new level of higher education, the place where we would learn a lot over the course of 3-4 years such as:</p>

<h4> Digital Photography</h4>
<p>This was where we would learn the Basics of operating a professional photo camera to camera to create some amazing pieces of photography which would help us when we improved our skills in the second semester</p>

<h4> Intro to Digital Media</h4>
<p> This was where we would start to learn the basic ideas of storytelling and filmmaking which is what you can see below</p>

<p>This was the video that I made back in my first semester in College, which is known as Beware of the Stare. This was assigned to us to do as part of the large part of the CA percentage. The film's concept was thought up by me and another student named Zhen. We filmed this over the spa of a few hours back around late November/ Early December and the film is about a student (played by David) being haunted and Traumatized by a notepad page ghost. Just when you thought College couldn't get any more scary.</p>
<h4>Web Development</h4>

<p> Back in my first Semester of College for my Web Development lecture we were assigned to do create a 10 page website based on a choice of 5 themes. I decided on the theme of Tv Shows and I based it on one of my favourite TV shows of Brooklyn Nine-Nine. It was based and made over the course of about a month and a bit and consisted on images, videos, opinion pieces, quotes, discriptions of characters and episodes and also a lot of HTMLs and a CSS stylesheets. It all thankfully worked out well and I did very well in the end </p> 


<h3> Semester 2 </h3>

<h4>Studio Photography </h4>

<img src="images/poser.jpg" height="300" width="400">
<img src="images/happiness.jpg" height="300" width="400">

<img src="images/close up.jpg" height="300" width="400">
<img src="images/product shot.jpg" height="300" width="400">

<p> to say that I can really work the camera is an understatement as you can clearly see from these images of me, but also of some product photography too with one of my final product shots.</p> 
<h4>Storytelling and Narrative</h4>

<p> storytelling is a lot like Visual creativity from Semester 1 (I don't have assets for that as the lecturer still has our sketchpads) in the sense it all involves the imagination being set into overdrive. In this course we discuss camera angles and breaking down character development in famous movie scenes. We are also currently making a short film of either live action or stop motion (mine will be stop motion animation known as the magic bone staring a human like dog named Baxter).

<h4>Image Manipulation</h4>

<img src="images/the last supper.jpg" height="300" width="400">
<img src="images/a day in the park.jpg" height="300" width="400">

<p> This is what happens when talent is just given free reign of Photoshop and its many assets to make some "art".</p> 
<h4> Design Process</h4>
<img src="images/Final poster.jpg" height="400" width="300">

<p> For this part of the course, we learn about the different styles of design that would help us if we were going into a career in design. It would help us with poster design through the concept of different colour palettes, typography, art styles and many more. So far we have created a concept poster for a particular theme (mine being on Mental Health and stress relief) and we are currently making an informational pamphlet/ poster about the Creative Digital Media course.</p>

<h4> Web Development 2</h4>
<p> For web Development in this semester we are learning more different styles of coding in HTML and CSS in Dreamweaver to help get the basic and the interesting methods of website design and coding. This will help us with our assignment of designing a student portfolio website which is what you are reading right now.</p>
