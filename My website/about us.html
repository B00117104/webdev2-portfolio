<h2>The Real Criminal Mastermind </h2>
<hr>
<p> So you want to know about the real mastermind behind this little charade of a website. Well you have come to the right place, so here is a brief rundown of our main perp.</p>
<br>
<p> So the creator of this little website is a criminal mastermind known as Sam harrison, 18 years of age, born in 2000 to a loving family. He has been described as a man with a plan, the master of skits, an actor of pure talent, a man of many wise words, the taker of hearts and love, the king of comedy, the hero of the shadows, a man of many personalities and an all around nice, kind and friendly person who's only crime is having too much of a pretty face </p>
<br>
<p> He created this website to show his appreciation and deep love for the well crafted, smartly written , well-acted and all around hilarious show of Brooklyn Nine-Nine and his long lasting love for it. When asked why did he do it he said, and I quote "in the words in the characters of the show, to show the support of THE NINE-NINE, as it is toit nups and quite cool, cool, cool, cool".</p>
<br>
<h3> crime: website creation and for having too pretty of a face </h3>
<br>
<h3> sentence: a pat on the back for a job well done </h3>
