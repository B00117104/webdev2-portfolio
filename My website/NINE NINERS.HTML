<h2>Welcome to the Nine-Nine</h2>
<p>Welcome to my website on Brooklyn Nine-Nine, one of the most smart, hilarious, well-written comedy shows on tv today. With an all star, yet multi-diversital cast playing the roles of cops in a fictional precinct in Brooklyn, it helped it to branch out to the creation of many stories throughout it's so far 5 seasons with a sixth season on the way next January. <p>
<br>
<p> I hope that you find some enjoyment out of my first attempt at a real proper creation of a website because I really do love this show and I want to give it that much more appreciation for how well it is created and why more people should watch this show, to help keep the officers of the ninty-ninth precinct working for that much longer.<p>
