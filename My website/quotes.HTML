<hr>
<main>
<p>These are just some of the best quotes from the show's 5 seasons from the different characters.</p>
<hr>
<h3> Peralta </h3>
<p>Jake: "I guess that's your new best friend now, Santiago. Emphasis on "Iago," backstaber"</p>
<p>Amy: "I'm surprised you've read Othello."</p>
<P>Jake:" What the hell's Othello? I'm calling you the parrot from Aladdin"</p>
<br>
<p>Jake: "Captain, hey! Welcome to the murder." </p>
<br>
<p>Jake: "[flashback] Mr. Santiago, I'm calling to inform you that I plan to ask your daughter to marry me, but since it's 2017, I am not asking you for your permission, as she is not your property, nor would she be mine, if she chooses to say yes. She's a strong independent woman, and she don't need no man. That being said, I truly hope she says yes. But it's her decision, so just back off!"</p>
<p>Amy: "Aww, that was perfect. What did he say?"</p>
<p>Jake: "I have no idea, I left a voicemail. I'm terrified of him."</p>
<hr>
<h3> Holt </h3>
<p>Holt: "Do you want to know how I actually hurt my wrist?"</p>
<p>Jake: "Yes."</P>
<p>Holt: "I was hula hooping. Kevin and I attend a class for fitness and for fun."</p>
<p>Jake: "Oh, my God."</p>
<p>Holt: "I've mastered all the moves. [Shows photos on phone] The pizza toss, the tornado, the scorpion, the oopsie-doodle."</p>
<p>Jake: "Why are you telling me this?"</p>
<p>Holt: "Because no one will ever believe you." [Deletes photos from phone]</p>
<p>Jake: "You sick son of a bitch."</p>
<br>
<p>TV host:"The cairn terrier is intelligent and inquisitive with a bold personality."</p>
<p>Holt:[chuckles]"A bold personality, we know what that's code for...she's a BITCH."</p>
<br>
<p>Terry: "Motorcycles are death machines. I have three kids. I'm not risking it."</p>
<p>Holt: "Are you saying my life matters less because I don't conform to society's heteronormative child-centric ideals?"</p>
<p>Terry: "Are you really playing the gay card right now?"</p>
<p>Holt:"Yas queen."</p>
<hr>
<h3> Santiago </h3>
<p>Amy: "It'll cheer the captain up. He'll be over the moon. He may even lean back in his chair and nod slightly."</p>
<hr>
<h3> Boyle </h3>
<p>Charles:"Oh, you're right. I'm gonna tell him. It might not be today. It might not be tomorrow. It definitely won't be later than tomorrow. So pretty much today or tomorrow then."</p>
<br>
<p>Charles:"Are you blackmailing me? I don't have any money, Hitchcock. I'm still paying my uncle's funeral bills. I rear-ended the hearse. It was a mess."</p>
<br>
<p>Boyle:"You're useless. You are completely useless. You are, without a doubt, the most incompetent detectives I've ever seen. And I am including that bomb sniffing dog that humps all the bombs."</p>
<hr>
<h3> Rosa </h3>
<p>Rosa:"And when this is over, I'm going to find you, and I'm going to break those little fingers."</p>
<p>Judge:"Ms. Diaz, please stop threatening the stenographer!"</p>
<br>
<p>Terry:"Talk to him, that's what friends do."</p>
Rosa:"Nope. I'm gonna wait 'til I'm on my deathbed, get in the last word and then die immediately."</p>
<p>Terry: "That's your plan for dealing with this? 
Rosa: That's my plan for dealing with everything. I have seventy-seven arguments I'm going to win that way."</P>
<br>
<p>Holt:"I don't need Monty Hall ruining my place at work when Monty Hall has already ruined my home life."</p>
<p>Diaz:"Come on, sir. The math thing isn't the problem. The night shift is keeping you and Kevin apart. You two just need to bone."</p>
<p>Holt:"What did you say?"</p>
<p>Amy:"[whispers] Don't say it again."</p>
<p>Diaz:"I said you two need to bone."</p>
<p>Holt:"How DARE YOU, DETECTIVE DIAZ. I AM YOUR SUPERIOR OFFICER!"</p>
<p>Holt:"BONE!!!!"</p>
<P>Holt:"What happens in my bedroom, Detective, is none of your business."</P>
<p>Holt:"BONE??!!"</p>
<p>Holt:"Don't ever speak to me like that again."</p>
<hr>
<h3> Terry </h3>
<p>Jake:"You guys, this is gonna be fine. I mean Terry's our boss and he comes with us every year."</p>
<p>Terry:"Correction, you bring Vacation Terry, and he is no man's boss. When the slippers are filled, Terry is chilled."</p>
<br>
<p>Terry:"I was raised on disco. Little Terry loved to hustle."</p>
<hr>
<h3> Gina </h3>
<p>Gina:"It's Gina's phone. Leave me a voice-mail. I won't check it 'cause it's not 1993."</p>
<br>
<p>Gina:"I'm scared of businessmen. A whole army of gray-suited Brads and Chads trying to suck my soul and redeem it for frequent flyer miles."</p>
<br>
<p>Boyle:"Gina. Gina. Gina, I screwed up, big time.</p>
<p>Gina:"Charles, given your daily life experiences, you're gonna have to be more specific."</p>
