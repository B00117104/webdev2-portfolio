<h2>it's time for the confession</h2>
<hr>
<p> for over the last 4-5 years that this show has been on the air on tv, it has changed my opinion on how a comedy or a tv show can be written that is funny, smart and can be serious and enlightening all at the same time.</p>
<br>
<p> The idea for a comedy in a police force works so well is because there are many possibilities for where a story can go, from training facilities, drug busts, stakeouts, to even witness protection, there is always somewhere where they can create a story for the characters to overcome </p>
<br>
<p> The show doesn't take the whole stereotype path, but instead has a range of different characters and it doesn't shy away from Diversity. The cast consists of two Latin American Actresses as two of the female leads, as well as two Black actors, where other networks and shows wouldn't even do.</p>
<br>
<p> in terms of stereotypes, no two characters are the same. The three leading ladies are have their own personalities, where one is well organized, one is mysterious, tough and takes action into her own hands and the other is always up to causing mayhem and doing it her way. They are not stereotyped of trying to be the best, standing around gossiping or trying to get a guy that they all fight for.</p>
<br>
<p> The Same goes with Sexuality. While the idea of LGBTQ+ is quite a touchy subject in the media, Brooklyn Nine-Nine embraces it and doesn't make it feel out of place and is quite well written. There is two characters that are confirmed to be in this category and that is Captain Raymond Holt and Rosa Diaz. From the first time Holt is introduced to the show, we learn that he is an openly gay black man and he is written really well and provides incredibly important and positive representation for the LGBTQ+ community. For Rosa we don't learn that she is actually Bisexual until mid season 5 and I thought it was well represented throughout the rest of the season, especially how difficult it can be for coming out to your parents in the following and how people would react. I hope to see more of great writing and establishment of LGBTQ+ characters in later seasons.</p>
<br>
<p> The last thing I will discuss that they distribute and explain very well is the concept of talking about touchy subjects. While I described about the idea of coming out as Bi-sexual is quite tricky to explain but was well executed, the other touchy subject that they describe well is the concept of race. While the show is quite funny and smartly written it also covers some very serious issues, especially race. The episode in particular they tackle this well is in season 4's episode "moo moo", where Terry get's stopped by another cop while he is off duty in his own neighbourhood. While he tries to file a complaint, Holt won't allow it, which leads into a excellently written and thought provoking monologue that truly show that this show can truly tackle serious issues too.</p>   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TSLYXPJ8Gk4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br>
<p> All of this is my opinion on why Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a great show in terms of comedy, smart writing and serious issues. </p>
